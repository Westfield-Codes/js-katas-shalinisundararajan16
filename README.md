### JS Katas

Here is how we use Kata files:

1. **script.js** is where you paste instruction comments, then build and test code.
2. **index.html** is the web page that chooses the script file to run. **Don't edit it.**
3. **katas-level-#.js** are instructions for writing code. Copy then to script as you need them.  **Don't edit them.**
4. **done.js** is where you can paste code you've built for reference.
5. **style.css** is something we're not up to  yet. 

Don't leave old code in script.js. You only want to run the new code you make to test it.  After you have finished working with a kata, move that code to done.js - or delete it.

Here is the correct order of practicing commands: 

1. **var & alert** (showing something in a pop-up): mixing string text and variables in an alert
2. **prompt** (asking users for variable values and including those in an alert)
3. **conditionals** (if/else if/else) - these have not been added yet. 

When you move from 1-3, either use the old code (they extend what comes before) or retype it to build fluency (better).
